## [0.2.0] - 2020-10-31
### Changed
- Forget the CSV functionality. It only hindered moving over tracks accurately. I thought they could be used as a sort of failsafe, but they actually increased complexity. Everything anyone needs to move files is already present within the ID3 metadata of each MP3 file. Some of the data is absent for some reason (including artists) but overall the effort is tremendously effective.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-10-31
### Added
- Initial version
